CRITICAL WARNING: [BD 41-1347] Reset pin /PWM_module_0/sys_rst_n (associated clock /PWM_module_0/sys_clk) is connected to asynchronous reset source /COM_IP_0/ctr_rstn.
This may prevent design from meeting timing. Instead it should be connected to reset source /rst_ps7_0_200M/peripheral_aresetn.

These constraints will be ignored for synthesis but will be used in implementation. Impacted constraints are listed in the file [.Xil/PWM_propImpl.xdc].
Resolution: To avoid this warning, move constraints listed in [.Xil/PWM_propImpl.xdc] to another XDC file and exclude this new file from synthesis with the used_in_synthesis property (File Properties dialog in GUI) and re-run elaboration/synthesis.
